# === General Line Ending Rules ===
# Set default behavior
* text=auto eol=lf

# Enforce LF for source code
*.py    text eol=lf
*.rs    text eol=lf
*.sh    text eol=lf
*.md    text eol=lf

# === Language Statistics (Linguist) ===
# Mark generated files so they don't skew stats
figures/**/*.html linguist-generated=true
figures/**/*.svg  linguist-generated=true
# Unmark index files (handwritten/templated)
figures/**/index.html linguist-generated=false text diff

# === Diff & Merge Drivers ===
# Use nbdime for clean Jupyter diffs
*.ipynb diff=nbdime

# Treat Cargo.lock as binary on merge to avoid conflicts
Cargo.lock merge=binary

# === Git LFS (Large File Storage) ===
# Track large data and figure files with LFS
# Note: You must run `git lfs track "..."` to generate these
#data/curated/*.csv           filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#data/curated/*.txt           filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#data/features/*.csv        filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#data/stats/*.csv           filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#data/parsed/*.json         filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#figures/annotated/*.mxl      filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#figures/**/*.png             filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# === Binary Files ===
# Mark all other binary files.
# LFS files are already marked as -text (binary), but this is a good fallback.

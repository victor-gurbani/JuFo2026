1. Pitch Range
DD Value: +25.14 semitones
Mozart actually narrowed the range compared to Bach (Velocity -5), but Chopin exploded it open (Velocity +20). The specific mathematical "force" of that reversal is 25.14.
2. Harmonic Density
DD Value: +0.75 pitch classes
What it tells us: Similar pattern. Mozart simplified harmony (Velocity -0.25), but Chopin thickened it significantly (+0.50). The net acceleration of 0.75 quantifies the "thickening" of texture that defines Romanticism.
3. Dissonance Ratio
DD Value: +0.31
What it tells us: Mozart cleaned up dissonances relative to Bach (Velocity -0.09). Chopin re-introduced them heavily (+0.23). The DD of 0.31 confirms that Romanticism isn't just "more dissonance"—it is a distinct rejection of Classical consonance.
4. Rhythmic Pattern Entropy (The Outlier)
DD Value: -0.10
What it tells us: This is nearly zero. It proves that Romanticism did NOT change rhythmic complexity compared to Classicism. The revolution here didn't happen until Debussy (where the DD jumps to +1.41).
